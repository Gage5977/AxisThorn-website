# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing package.json
**Issue**: The project was missing a package.json file, which Vercel needs to understand dependencies and build process.
**Fix**: Created package.json with:
- All required dependencies (stripe, jsonwebtoken, uuid)
- Build scripts including `build:vercel` that builds and copies files
- Proper Node.js version requirement (>=18.0.0)

### 2. Incorrect Build Configuration
**Issue**: vercel.json was set to "No build required" but the project uses webpack
**Fix**: Updated vercel.json to:
- Use `npm run build:vercel` as build command
- Configure API functions with proper timeout
- Include all necessary rewrites, redirects, and security headers

### 3. Missing .vercelignore
**Issue**: Unnecessary files were being uploaded to Vercel
**Fix**: Created .vercelignore to exclude:
- Source files and development dependencies
- Build configuration files
- Documentation and temporary files

## Deployment Steps

1. **Install Dependencies Locally** (for testing):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:vercel
   ```

3. **Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   Add these in your Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   JWT_SECRET=[32+ character random string]
   PAYMENT_API_KEY=[secure API key]
   DEMO_CLIENT_SECRET=[change from default]
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Common Deployment Issues

### Build Fails
- Check Vercel build logs for missing dependencies
- Ensure Node.js version matches (>=18.0.0)
- Verify all environment variables are set

### API Functions Not Working
- Check function logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify environment variables are accessible

### Static Files Not Found
- Confirm files are in the `public` directory after build
- Check that webpack is copying all necessary files
- Verify rewrites in vercel.json are correct

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] package.json exists with all dependencies
- [ ] vercel.json has correct build command
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Static assets load properly
- [ ] Payment functionality works (test mode first)

## Support
For deployment issues, check:
1. Vercel build logs
2. Function logs for API errors
3. Browser console for frontend errors
4. Network tab for failed requests
