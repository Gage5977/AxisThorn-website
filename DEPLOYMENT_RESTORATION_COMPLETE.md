### 🔧 DNS Configuration Needed

The domain `axisthorn.com` is configured in Vercel but appears to have DNS issues. To fix:

1. Check nameserver configuration at your domain registrar
2. Ensure nameservers point to Vercel:
   - ns1.vercel-dns.com
   - ns2.vercel-dns.com

Or if using third-party DNS:
- Add CNAME record: @ -> cname.vercel-dns.com
- Add A record: @ -> 76.76.21.21
