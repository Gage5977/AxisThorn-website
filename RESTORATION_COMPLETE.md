# Website Restoration Complete

## Date: 2025-06-21

### ✅ What Was Done

2. **Restored All Files**: 
   - Replaced public/ directory with backup version
   - Restored src/ and dist/ directories
   - Removed API, middleware, and Prisma directories
   - Restored simple vercel.json without complex configurations
3. **Deployed Working Version**: Successfully deployed to axis-thorn-website project

### 📁 What Was Removed

- `/api` directory (middleware and authentication)
- `/api-deployment` directory
- `/prisma` directory (database files)
- `/lib` directory
- Complex vercel.json configurations
- All security/authentication JavaScript files

### 🌐 Current Status

### 🔧 DNS Issue Still Present

The custom domain axisthorn.com still has SSL/connection issues due to Cloudflare configuration. To fix:
1. Login to Cloudflare
2. Disable proxy (orange cloud → grey cloud)
3. Or switch nameservers to Vercel

### 💾 Backups Created

- Security updates saved in: `/security-updates-backup/`
- Can be re-implemented later if needed
