   - Option 3: Use Vercel Functions (requires specific file structure)

2. **For Custom Domain:**
   - Check DNS settings in Vercel dashboard
   - Verify nameservers are pointing correctly

## Deployment URLs

## Summary

The main website functionality is now working correctly on Vercel. The banking portal 404 issue has been resolved. The only remaining issue is the API endpoints, which need a different deployment approach as outlined in the project documentation.
