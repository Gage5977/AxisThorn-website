# Banking Portal Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Source Files
- **Issue**: `banking.html` was missing from the `/src` directory
- **Fix**: Copied from `/dist` to `/src` to ensure webpack can build it

### 2. Banking Portal Not in Build
- **Issue**: `banking-portal.html` wasn't included in webpack build process
- **Fix**: 
  - Moved `banking-portal.html` from `/public` to `/src`
  - Added to webpack.config.js for proper processing

### 3. Missing Navigation Link
- **Issue**: Homepage didn't link to banking portal
- **Fix**: Added banking portal card to System Access section in `src/index.html`

### 4. Build Configuration
- **Issue**: Webpack referenced non-existent files (1099.html, consultation.html, etc.)
- **Fix**: Removed missing file references from webpack config

## Current Status

✅ **Banking Portal** (`/banking-portal.html`)
- Full 1099 management system
- Payment history tracking
- Secure banking instructions
- AXIS Terminal integration

✅ **Banking Page** (`/banking.html`)
- Wire transfer instructions
- ACH payment details
- Stripe online payment integration
- Security protocols

✅ **Navigation**
- Banking portal linked from homepage
- Both pages accessible from navigation

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix banking portal deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables** in Vercel:
   - All Stripe keys
   - JWT_SECRET
   - Payment security keys

3. **Deploy**:
   - Vercel will automatically deploy on push
   - Or manually trigger: `vercel --prod`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Homepage shows banking portal link
- [ ] Banking portal loads at `/banking-portal.html`
- [ ] Banking page loads at `/banking.html`
- [ ] Navigation works on mobile
