# SOLUTION: Switch to Vercel DNS

## The Problem
Your API token has IP restrictions that prevent automated DNS record creation. Cloudflare's interface isn't saving the A records properly.

## The Solution: Use Vercel DNS Instead
Since your domain is already configured on Vercel's side, switch your nameservers to let Vercel handle DNS completely.

## Steps to Fix (5 minutes):

### 1. Find Your Domain Registrar
Check where you bought axisthorn.com:
- GoDaddy: godaddy.com
- Namecheap: namecheap.com  
- Google Domains: domains.google.com
- Other registrar

### 2. Change Nameservers
In your registrar's control panel:
- Find "DNS" or "Nameservers" settings
- Change from:
  - dorthy.ns.cloudflare.com
  - quentin.ns.cloudflare.com
- To:
  - ns1.vercel-dns.com
  - ns2.vercel-dns.com

### 3. Save Changes
- Click Save/Update
- Wait 5-15 minutes for propagation

## Why This Works Better
- ✅ Vercel handles all DNS automatically
- ✅ No manual A record creation needed
- ✅ SSL certificates auto-configured
- ✅ No API token restrictions
- ✅ Perfect integration with your website

## Current Status
- ✅ Website working: https://axis-thorn-llc-website.vercel.app
- ✅ Vercel project configured
- ❌ DNS pointing to wrong servers

## After Nameserver Change
Your website will work at:
- https://axisthorn.com
- https://www.axisthorn.com

This is the cleanest, most reliable solution.
