## üîß Remaining Tasks

### Update Other Service Pages:
The consultation.html and implementation.html pages still need updating to match the new navigation. They should:
1. Use `axis-2025.css` instead of `styles.css`
2. Use the new navigation structure
3. Update JavaScript references to use `navigation-2025.js` and `axis-2025.js`

### Create Navigation Template:
Consider creating a reusable navigation component to ensure consistency across all pages.

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Stripe is LIVE**: All payments through the vendor portal will be real transactions
2. **Monitor Webhook Events**: Check Stripe dashboard for payment confirmations
3. **Test Authentication**: Ensure JWT tokens are working for payment authentication
4. **Email Notifications**: Set up email notifications for successful payments

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Navigation not working**: Check that `navigation-2025.js` is loading correctly
2. **Styles missing**: Ensure `axis-2025.css` is referenced properly
3. **Payment errors**: Check browser console and Stripe dashboard logs
4. **404 errors**: Verify all file paths are correct in Vercel
