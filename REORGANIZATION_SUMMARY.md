# Website Reorganization Summary

## Date: 2025-06-19

### Actions Taken:

1. **Removed Duplicate Files from Root Directory**
   - Removed 11 files that were identical duplicates of files in the public/ directory:
     - 1099.html
     - banking.html
     - implementation.html
     - index.html
     - invoices.html
     - script.js
     - styles.css
     - support.html
     - test-deployment.html
     - test.html

2. **Updated consultation.html**
   - The root version had newer accessibility attributes
   - Updated public/consultation.html with the newer version from root

3. **Moved Unique Files to Public Directory**
   - Moved 3 files that were only in root to public/:
     - favicon-generator.html
     - stripe-helper.js
     - test-logo-variants.html

4. **Preserved Directory Structure**
   - Kept API directory in root (as required by Vercel serverless functions)
   - Kept all configuration files in root (vercel.json, package.json, etc.)
   - Maintained public/ as the deployment directory (per vercel.json configuration)
   - Left src/ directory structure empty for future development

### Current Structure:
- All HTML, CSS, and JS files are now in public/
- API endpoints remain in api/
- Configuration and build files remain in root
- No breaking changes to deployment

### Backup:
- Created backup-root-files/ directory with copies of unique/different files before deletion
