# DNS/SSL Issue Analysis for axisthorn.com

## Issue Summary
The domain axisthorn.com has DNS resolution but SSL/TLS handshake fails.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Nameserver Mismatch**
- **Current**: Cloudflare nameservers (dorthy.ns.cloudflare.com, quentin.ns.cloudflare.com)
- **Expected**: Vercel nameservers (ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com)

### 2. **DNS Configuration Conflict**
- Domain is registered with Cloudflare DNS
- Vercel expects to manage DNS directly
- This creates SSL certificate provisioning issues

### 3. **SSL Certificate Problem**
- Vercel can't provision SSL certificates when using third-party DNS
- SSL handshake fails with `SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL`

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Vercel DNS (Recommended)
1. Go to your domain registrar
2. Change nameservers to:
   - ns1.vercel-dns.com
   - ns2.vercel-dns.com
3. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
4. Vercel will automatically provision SSL

### Option 2: Keep Cloudflare DNS
1. In Cloudflare dashboard:
   - Set SSL/TLS mode to "Full (strict)"
   - Disable Cloudflare proxy (grey cloud) for axisthorn.com
   - Add CNAME record: @ -> cname.vercel-dns.com
   - Or A record: @ -> 76.76.21.21
2. In Vercel:
   - May need to manually trigger SSL certificate generation

### Option 3: Use Cloudflare for Vercel (Workers)
1. Keep Cloudflare proxy enabled
2. Set up Cloudflare Workers to proxy to Vercel
3. Configure SSL settings in Cloudflare

## Current Status
- ✅ DNS resolves to correct IP (76.76.21.21)
- ❌ SSL handshake fails
- ❌ HTTPS connections timeout
- ❌ HTTP connections get empty response

## Quick Fix
The fastest solution is to disable Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud → grey cloud) in Cloudflare dashboard for the axisthorn.com record. This will allow direct connection to Vercel while keeping Cloudflare as DNS provider.
