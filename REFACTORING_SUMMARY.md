# Website Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Axis Thorn LLC website has been successfully refactored to follow modern web development best practices, improve maintainability, and enhance performance.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Project Structure
- **Before**: Mixed source and deployment files in root and public directories
- **After**: Clean separation with `src/` for source files and `dist/` for build output
- **Benefit**: Clear organization and single source of truth

### 2. JavaScript Modularization
- **Before**: Single 677-line script.js file
- **After**: 10+ ES6 modules with clear responsibilities
- **Benefit**: Better code organization, reusability, and maintainability

### 3. CSS Optimization
- **Before**: 102 !important declarations in styles.css, inline CSS in invoices.html
- **After**: ~10 !important declarations, external CSS files, proper cascade usage
- **Benefit**: Cleaner CSS, better accessibility, easier maintenance

### 4. Build Process
- **Before**: Manual file copying, no optimization
- **After**: Webpack build with minification, bundling, and content hashing
- **Benefit**: Optimized performance, automated builds, cache busting

### 5. Deployment Workflow
- **Before**: Manual deployment process
- **After**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Vercel
- **Benefit**: Consistent deployments, preview environments, reduced errors

## New File Structure
```
/
├── src/                    # Source files
│   ├── js/                # JavaScript modules
│   ├── css/               # Stylesheets
│   ├── assets/            # Images and static files
│   └── *.html             # HTML templates
├── dist/                  # Build output (gitignored)
├── api/                   # Serverless functions
├── webpack.config.js      # Build configuration
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
└── vercel.json           # Deployment configuration
```

## Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run build:vercel` - Build for Vercel deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Build and sync to public directory
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts

## Performance Improvements
- JavaScript bundle size reduced through code splitting
- CSS minified and optimized with PostCSS
- Assets optimized with content hashing for caching
- Lazy loading for non-critical resources

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
4. Deploy to Vercel: Push to main branch (automatic via GitHub Actions)

## Migration Notes
- The `public/` directory is maintained for backward compatibility
- All new development should happen in `src/`
- Build output goes to `dist/` which is deployed to Vercel
- API functions remain in the root `api/` directory
